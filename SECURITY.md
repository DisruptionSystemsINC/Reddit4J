# Security Policy
We take security very seriously, and believe in responsible disclosing of vulnerabilities. Although this is a simple REST API wrapper, and we don't expect a lot of security issues, we will take all issues into immediate consideration.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Reporting a vulnerability should be done privately, either on discord to me (masecla22#4309) or by contacting me on my email supermasecla22@gmail.com
